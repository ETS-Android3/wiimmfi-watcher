# TODO
These are issues in Wiimmfi Watcher I am at least aware of. Please **DO NOT** submit a bug report on the Google Form or an issue here on GitHub if it is mentioned on this list, unless you found a way that the bug can crash the app.

## Completed For Next Release

## Working On
* The last player in the list has the potential to hide behind the refresh button
* Create the app on the Play Store
* Create a meaningful README

## Aware Of
* Fix the repeating recent friend codes
* Recent friend codes do not scroll like they should
    * Problem with ConstraintLayout probably, convert to a new Layout?

# Features I would like to add
* The watcher activity does not refresh automatically like the official website does
    * Added a refresh button, but is there a better way with Jsoup? Like a new Thread?
