    <string name="about_me">Hi there! My name is Bryson Steck. I am a student studying Computer Science. This is my first official application that I\'m maintaining. This whole \"application on the Google Play Store\" thing is new to me, so please be patient as I am learning how to maintain something like this. I hope you enjoy!</string>
    <string name="about_watcher">Wiimmfi Watcher is an UNOFFICIAL application created for a school project that I have decided to turn into a full application. This application was made to provide an easy shortcut to the Wiimmfi website and display data in a mobile friendly way, since the official website doesn\'t have a mobile friendly version. Free and open source, you can watch your Wiimmfi matches on your phone in a quick and easy way. </string>
