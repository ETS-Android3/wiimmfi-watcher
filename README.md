# Wiimmfi Watcher

Wiimmfi Watcher is an Android application that allows you to watch Mario Kart Wii gameplay by simply entering your friend code. 

## TODO

* Get the fragments to display correctly
* Learn if the database or rooms will help with saving the friend codes
* Learn how the MVVM should work with the app
* Learn how to "refresh" the fragment contents
* Figure out how to use two fragments at once
