## This is the `dev` branch!!
**You are on the `dev` branch for Wiimmfi Watcher.** This is seperate from the `master` branch, which contains the currently most stable version, while this branch is made for me to work on the app without changing currently stable code. If you are looking for the `master` branch, [click here.](https://github.com/brysonsteck/wiimmfi-watcher/tree/master)

# Wiimmfi Watcher

Wiimmfi Watcher is an Android application that allows you to watch Mario Kart Wii gameplay by simply entering your friend code. 

## TODO

* Fix the repeating recent friend codes (if possible)
* Create the app on the Play Store
* Create a meaningful README
